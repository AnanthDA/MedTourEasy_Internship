# Analysis-Of-Death-Age-Difference-Of-Left-Handers-and-Right-Handers

- Barak Obama, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Babe Ruth, and Marie Curie are notable individuals who are left-handed, showcasing that left-handedness is not uncommon among prominent figures.

- According to a 1991 study, left-handed people were reported to die on average nine years earlier than right-handed people, a claim that warrants further investigation.

- The aim of this project is to explore the potential link between left-handedness and average age at death using age distribution data. We will utilize Bayesian statistics and pandas to analyze the probability of reaching a certain age at death based on reported hand preferences (left-handed or right-handed).

- In 1986, researchers Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki conducted a National Geographic survey with over a million responses, collecting data on age, sex, and hand preference for throwing and writing. The study revealed that rates of left-handedness were approximately 13% among people younger than 40 but decreased with age, reaching about 5% by the age of 80. Gilbert and Wysocki inferred that this age-dependence was primarily due to changing social acceptability of left-handedness, suggesting that the rates were more influenced by the year of birth rather than age specialization. If the same study were conducted today, we would expect a similar distribution, but with a shift related to changing rates of left-handedness over time. Ultimately, this project aims to determine the effect of this changing rate on the apparent mean age at death.

- To conduct this analysis, two datasets will be used: one containing death distribution data and another containing rates of left-handedness. By examining these datasets and applying Bayesian statistics, we can gain insights into whether left-handedness is indeed associated with an earlier average age at death or if the observed difference is a result of changing rates of left-handedness across different generations.
